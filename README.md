# bertoJSON
puny library project for my second coding project

This library will soon provide a minimal implementation for a pretty printing library for JSON with no level of costumization.

content:
1) printing JSON data structure "compressed" in a single line
2) more human readable structure with tab indented line (every line contain at most one value)
3) TODO actual JSON parser for reading at least the file this library is able to write. will be actually done only if enough motivation and cleverness is found.

PS: i believe tab are useful for indenting so it will consistently used whenever possible (tab and space used simultaneosly only for different purposes) and that every text file (except one line file) should end with an empty line

PPS: the previous PS was dumb
